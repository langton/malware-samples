### Contents

Deles.cs was packed (nested 2-deep, actually) in an [executable labeled "Multicoin.exe" on SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/multicoin/).

Form.cs, from "Gemvision Matrix 7.0 Build 3483.exe"
[(VirusTotal entry)](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/7f9e44acee88d1bab12dfcc92deadfa1fd052dd0686d2cf388c41219d0461e7b/analysis/),
simulates a failed installation process, with randomly generated error
messages. Given the various filenames this binary can be found under,
and its apparent white-listing by the major AVs, I suspect this
application is a decoy intended to frustrate warez-seekers.
